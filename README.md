# ReimbursementProject

Full-stack Web development project made in 2 weeks from technologies that I started off unfamiliar with. Technologies used, from backend to frontend:

**Amazon AWS RDS**
  Used to host the relational database that holds user & reimbursement data.
**PostgreSQL**
  Database management system and superset of SQL scripting languages. Accessed at developer-side using **DBeaver**.
**JDBC**
  Server-side database connection and data retrieval. Native to the **Java** programming language.
**Maven**
  Project structure & dependency manager. Used to manage the local Java project.
**Apache Tomcat**
  Web-server backend framework for Java projects. Uses front-facing Java Http Servlets.
